IslamicTimer is a software package consisting of programs for generating 
Islamic Calendars, translating Gregorian/Julian dates to/from dates in 
the Islamic Calendar, computing prayer time schedules, and for determining
the direction of the Qiblah.  It also includes a prayers time reminder/
notification service.

This is release 2.1 of IslamicTimer.  It includes the following:

	README   - this file.

	hdate    - a directory containing the source, documentation,
		   background information, and makefile for HDATE and 
		   HCAL.  HDATE prints the current Islamic (Hijri) date
		   and translates dates between the Hijri calendar and the 
		   Gregorian/Julian Calendar.   HCAL prints calendars 
		   (for a Hijri/Gregorian month or an entire year) with 
		   both common and Hijri dates.

	praytime - a directory containing the source, documentation, and
		   makefile for PRAYTIME, a program that generates
		   Islamic prayer time schedules and computes the 
		   direction of the Qiblah for any location.  
		   The schedules can be generated for both Hijri or
		   Gregorian months or years.

	premind  - a directory containing the source, documentation, and
		   makefile for PREMIND, a program that works in conjunction 
		   with PRAYTIME and provides prayers time notification/
		   reminder service.  (premind works on UNIX platforms only.)

The software should be fairly portable and it should run on both UNIX
and DOS platforms (DOS executables are included in this release).  If you
have to make any changes to files other than the Makefiles to make these 
programs work on your machine/compiler, please contact me and tell me 
where I goofed.

All the programs are Copyrighted.  Permission for nonprofit use and 
redistribution of the software and its documentation is granted without 
fee.
