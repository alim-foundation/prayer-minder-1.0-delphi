This directory contains release 2.1 of PREMIND.  PREMIND provides a prayers
time reminder service.   It is designed to work in conjunction with
PRAYTIME, and would run ONLY on UNIX platforms.   

This distribution includes the following files:

	README  - this file.
	premind.1 - reference manual page (nroff/troff -man).
	premind.hlp - output of "nroff -man premind.1 |col -b".
	Makefile - also contains geographical coordinates of many cities.
	premind.c - C source  file for premind.
	killpr - a shell script to cancel premind service

Installing Premind:

Premind determines prayers times by invoking and reading the
output of "praytime".  You must therefore have the executable for 
"praytime" present in the current working directory or installed in 
some other directory which is in the shell search PATH.  
Read the manual page for further instructions.
