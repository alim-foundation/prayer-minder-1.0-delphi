.TH PREMIND 1L "premind Version 2.1"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
premind, killpr \- Islamic prayers time reminder/notification service
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpremind\fR [\fB-d\fR \fImin\fP] [\fIptcommand\fR]
.br
\fBkillpr\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIPremind\fP waits until the next prayers' time, and then notifies/reminds
you that it's time for prayers.   Reminder messages are sent to the initiating
terminal 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual time, at prayers
time, and one minute after.   The \fB-d\fP option may be used to set
the advance warning time to \fImin\fP minutes, instead of the default 5
minutes.
.PP
\fIPremind\fP is designed to work in conjunction with \fIpraytime\fP(1L).
To determine prayers' times, \fIpremind\fP automatically (once a day)
executes, reads, and parses the output of \fIptcommand\fP, a praytime shell 
command given as an argument.  If no argument is given, the default command
(normally configured to be "praytime") is used.
.PP
The \fIptcommand\fP must be quoted if it contains blanks or other special
characters, as illustrated by the following example commands:
.RS
.sp
premind "praytime -a15 -r2"
.sp
premind -d 10 "praytime -i <mycity.data"
.RE
.PP
\fIPremind\fP runs in the background as an orphan process.  (An orphan process
is a process whose parent has exited and that has been inherited by the 
\fIinit\fP(8) process.)  \fIPremind\fP ignores interrupts, quits, and 
terminates.  To get rid of it you should either log off or use the
\fIkillpr\fP command (see below).  When you log off, \fIpremind\fP exits just 
before it would have printed the next message or at most two hours after you 
log off, whichever comes first.  
.PP
The service cancellation command, \fIkillpr\fP, is a shell script which 
finds \fIpremind\fP processes you have running on the current
terminal/window and quietly terminates them.
