This directory contains release 2.1 PRAYTIME.  PRAYTIME is a modified version
of Kamal Abdali's program "prayertime."  

This distribution includes the following files:
	README  - this file.
	praytime.1 - reference manual page (nroff/troff -man).
	praytime.hlp - output of "nroff -man praytime.1 |col -b".
	Makefile - also contains geographical coordinates of many cities.
	praytime.c - C source  file for praytime.
	praytime.exe - DOS excutable  (see praytime.hlp for information
		       about how to set the parameters for your location)

COMPILING PRAYTIME:

The computation of the times of prayers for a given location involves the 
determination of times of specific Sun positions (e.g., sunrise, sunset,
midday, twilight) at that location.  Thus, in order to install PRAYTIME,
you need to edit the Makefile to specify the geographical data for your 
location, then type "make".  (If you wish to force a recompilation, type
"make clean" and then type "make".)

The Makefile already contains information (longitude and latitude) about most 
major cities in the US and a number of cities elsewhere.  If you are in the
US, and information about your town/city is not already included in the 
Makefile, you may use the Geographic Name Server (courtesy of the U. of
Michigan) to find out the exact latitude and longitude of your city/town.
Simply telnet to port 3000 at martini.eecs.umich.edu and type your ZIP code.
Here is an example:

 %telnet martini.eecs.umich.edu 3000

If your town/city is outside the US, you may be able to find its
longitude and latitude by calling your local airport or library.
