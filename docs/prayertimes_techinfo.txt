----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
4.1 Definitions of Prayer Times 
=============================== 
 
The five Islamic prayers are termed Fajr, Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Isha.  
Twilight is the period before sunrise and after sunset when the sky is  
partially illuminated by scattered sunlight. The start of fajr and isha  
depend on twilight. In astronomy, the twilight period is divided into civil,
nautical and astronomical twilight which come to an end when the solar 
depression  is 6, 12, and 18 degrees respectively.  
 
For the purpose of calculating fajr and isha times a solar depression of  
18 degrees is generally used i.e. astronomical twilight. 
 
At extreme latitudes solar depression may not exceed 18 degrees for certain 
months of the year and hence twilight persists between sunset and next sunrise  
(see below). 
 
 
* FAJR starts with the dawn or morning twilight. Fajr ends just before  
sunrise. 
 
* ZUHR begins after mid-day when the sun has passed the meridian (i.e. after  
zawal). For convenience, many published prayer timetables add five  
minutes to zawal to obtain the start of Zuhr. Zuhr ends at the start of  
Asr time. 
 
* The timing of ASR depends on the length of the shadow cast by an object.  
According to the Shafi school of jurisprudence, Asr begins when the  
length of the shadow of an object exceeds the length of the object. According  
to the Hanafi school of jurisprudence, Asr begins when the length of the  
shadow exceeds TWICE the length of the object. In both cases, the minimum  
length of shadow (which occurs when the sun passes the meridian) is  
subtracted from the length of the shadow before comparing it with the  
length of the object. 
 
* MAGHRIB begins at sunset and ends at the start of isha.  
  
* ISHA starts after dusk when the evening twilight disappears. 
 
 
 
4.2 Persisting Twilight 
======================= 
 
At extreme latitudes the twilight may persist between sunset and the next  
sunrise. Hence there is no true night. Under these circumstances, Fajr and  
Isha times may be calculated using one of four agreed principles: 
 
 
1.  Nearest latitude (Aqrab Al-Balad) - add the interval between sunset and  
isha for a location on latitude 48 degrees to the local sunset time to  
obtain time for local isha. Similarly the interval between fajr and sunrise 
for a location on latitude 48 degrees is subtracted from local sunrise to 
obtain local fajr time.  
 
2.  Nearest day (Aqrab Al-Ayyam) - use fajr and isha times from the last  
day when it was possible to calculate these times in the normal way for 
that location. 
 
3.  Middle of night (Nisf Al-Lail) - split interval between sunrise and  
sunset into two halves. Isha is offered before the midpoint (e.g. 15 minutes  
before) and fajr is offered after the midpoint. 
 
4. One seventh of night (Sube Al-Lail) - split interval between sunset and  
sunrise into seven segments. Isha is offered after the first segment and   
fajr is offered after the sixth segment. 
 
 
The program uses the fourth method (1/7th night rule) to give alternative 
fajr and isha times for use when the normal times are undefined. These 
alternative fajr and isha times are provided as a guide only. They should 
not be regarded as absolute standards. Some users may find  that one of 
the other three alternatives is more suitable for their location. Whichever 
method is used to calculate alternative Fajr/ Isha times, it is important 
that the same method is used for both fasting and prayer! The phenomenon 
of persisting twilight does not occur for locations within the latitude 
range 48S to 48N (approximately) when a twilight angle of 18 degrees is used. 
 
 
 
4.3 Mathematical Equations for Prayer Times 
=========================================== 
 
To calculate the prayer times for a certain place we need to know the  
latitude (B) and longitude  (L) of the location and its reference 
longitude (R). B and L may be obtained from an atlas and R may be calculated 
by multiplying 15 by the difference between local time and GMT 
(i.e. 15 x Time Band). 
 
We also need to know two astronomical measures called the declination angle 
of the sun (D) and the real time-mean time difference, also known as the 
equation of time (T).  
 
Declination is the angular distance between a celestial object and the  
celestial equator. The Declination and the Right Ascension are used  
together to give the position of a star with reference to the celestial  
equator and the vernal equinox respectively. 
 
The equation of time is a correction to be added to apparent solar time, 
as read on a sundial, to obtain mean solar time, as commonly used. This  
difference is a consequence of the ellipticity and tilt of the Earth's  
orbit, causing the irregular apparent movement of the Sun across the sky. 
 
D and T vary according to the time of year and can be obtained accurately  
from The Star Almanac or calculated approximately as in this program. 
  
The following equations may be used to calculate the prayer times: 
 
 
 
	(R-L)    T 
Z = 12+ ----- + ---					........1 
	 15      60			 
  	               			  
 
 
 
    1        {sin(-0.8333-0.0347(H)^0.5)}-sinD.sinB 
U= -- arccos --------------------------------------  	........2
   15                   cosD.cosB          
			                  
 
 
 
    1        -sinG-sinD.sinB 
V= -- arccos --------------- 				........3
   15          cosD.cosB 
                                        
 
 
 
    1        sin{arccot(1+tan(B-D)}-sinD.sinB 
W= -- arccos -------------------------------- 		........4
   15                 cosD.cosB 
                                  
 
 
 
    1        sin{arccot(2+tan(B-D)}-sinD.sinB 
X= -- arccos -------------------------------- 		........5
   15                 cosD.cosB 
 			 
				 
 
 
where  
 
B= latitude of place 
L= longitude of place 
R= reference longitude (i.e. TIME BAND x 15) 
H= height above sea level in metres 
D= declination angle of sun from celestial equator (-ve in southern hemisphere)
T= mean time - real time difference, i.e. equation of time 
G= twilight angle 
 
Fajr = Z-V 
Sunrise = Z-U  
Zuhr  = Z 
Asr1 (Shafi) = Z+W 
Asr2 (Hanafi) = Z+X 
Maghrib/Sunset = Z+U 
Isha = Z+V 
 
 
The program automatically calculates approximate values for T and D from  
the date (algorithms not shown here). Zuhr time is calculated using equation 1.
The time for sunrise and sunset/ maghrib may be calculated by subtracting or
adding 'U'(obtained from equation 2) to the Zuhr time respectively. In 
calculating sunrise and sunset, the program takes into account the height of
the location above sea level (if it has been entered into the database). 
 
Fajr and Isha times may be calculated by subtracting or adding 'V'  
(obtained from equation 3) to the Zuhr time respectively. The term G  
(twilight angle) in equation 3 is usually set to 18 degrees.  
For a location with an extreme latitude, days in summer may be so long that 
twilight persists between sunset and the next sunrise. Under these  
circumstances, 'V' is undefined and Fajr and Isha have to be determined  
using agreed principles of fiqh. Version 2.x  of the program is able to  
display 'fajr/7' and 'isha/7'  i.e. when there is no 'true night' (twilight  
persists between sunset and next sunrise) the period between sunset and  
next sunrise is divided into seven segments.  Isha is performed after the 
first segment and fajr after six segments as described above. 
 
The start of Asr time (Shafi) may be obtained by adding 'W' (obtained from  
equation 4) to Zuhr; Asr time (Hanafi) is calculated by adding 'X' obtained
from equation 5) to Zuhr. 

 
 
 
4.4 Qibla Direction 
=================== 
 
The Qibla direction may be calculated by using spherical trigonometry. 
 
 
 
		 	sin(Lm-L) 
Q = arctan	------------------------------- 
        	cos(Bm).tan B - sin B.cos(Lm-L) 
 
 
 
where 

Q= Qibla bearing from geographic North 
Lm= longitude of Makkah 
L= longitude of place 
Bm= latitude of Makkah 
B= latitude of place 
 
Although the program allows the latitude and longitude of a location to be 
entered to the nearest minute, for the purposes of calculating Qibla direction,
the reference co-ordinates of Makkah (Kaaba) are stored internally  with 
greater accuracy i.e. 21:25:16 N and 39:49:29.1 E. 

Note that the Qibla direction is relative to geographic north and not 
magnetic north (as determined by a compass). Geographic and magnetic norths 
will vary depending on location. This difference is known as magnetic 
declination and also changes with time. Information on magnetic 
declinations for a particular location may be obtained from magnetic atlases 
(e.g. reference 9).

From a practical point of view, geographic north-south may be determined
using the time of local solar meridian crossing (zawal). The program 
automatically calculates and displays zawal. At this time, a vertical rod 
placed on the ground will cast a shadow along the geographic north-south 
axis.



4.5 Shortest Distance to Makkah
=============================== 

The shortest distance of a place from Makkah in nautical miles is: 
 
	Distance = 60*arcos {sin B.sin(Bm) + cos B.cos Bm.cos(Lm-L)} 
 
Note:  
	1 International Nautical Mile	= 1.150779 statute miles  
					= 1.852km exactly 
					= 2025 yards approximately 

	1 Statute Mile = 1760 yards = 1.609km

6. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prayer Times Calculator is under constant development. Some possible
enhancements for future releases include:

*Improved Summer Time/ Daylight Saving Time routines. If the present DST 
options are not suitable for your location then switch this feature off and 
manually adjust the times.

*Mouse support and perhaps a WIMP environment.

*If there is sufficient demand, I may produce a Windows version.

*I am also presently working on another program called 'MOON CALCULATOR'. 
This program provides information relating to the position, phase, age,
bright limb angle and visibility of the moon for any given date, time and 
location on earth. It also gives the time and direction of moonrise and 
moonset, date/time of astronomical new moon and full moon and predicts 
the location, date/time and direction of the earliest crescent sighting for 
a given lunar month (using a variety of sighting criteria). Graphic displays 
showing the position of the moon on a star chart, the position of the moon 
in a simulated sky and a close-up of the moon are also provided. World maps
showing zones where crescent sightings (using a variety of sighting criteria) 
are likely are also provided. The program is at an advanced stage of
development and is undergoing error testing.
